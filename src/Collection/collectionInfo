 Collection :  List,set, queue


 Comparable - natural sorting (compareTo)
 Comparator - used when we want to perform customized sorting on the collection. (compare)
 By default String , and other wrapper classes has compareTo method, StringBuffer doesnt has this method.
 Thats why ClassCastException is thrown when we used stringBuffer with TreeSet
